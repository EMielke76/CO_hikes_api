Bluebird Lake ,Rocky Mountain National Park,https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/colorado/bluebird-lake-trail,"This is without a doubt my favorite hike in the entire state.

Longs Peak,Rocky Mountain National Park,https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/colorado/the-keyhole-and-longs-peak-trail,"THE Colorado hike. Longs is amazing, grueling, insanely rewarding hike. I'd recommend splitting it into 2-days, there is designated camping just beneath the keyhole if you want to split the hike into even chunks. Definitely doable in a day, but that's gonna be a LONG day (on the trail at 2am, back to the car at 5pm type day)",out and back ,14.8,true ,unknown
Blue and Mitchel Lakes,Indian Peaks Wilderness,https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/colorado/blue-lake-and-little-blue-lake-via-mitchell-lake-trail,"An absolutely stunning summer day-trip hike. 3 beautiful, easily accessbile lakes.

Conundrum Hotsprings,White River National Forest,https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/colorado/conundrum-creek-trail-to-conundrum-hot-springs,"The GOAT high-alpine hotspring experience.
